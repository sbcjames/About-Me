    <main>
      <p>Hello, I am James Swift. No relationship to Taylor Swift, I knew it would be your first question. The only near famous thing I am linked to is when I was younger I was an extra in movies and some tv shows. This all took place in Washington, so nothing to famous. But I was in Sleepless in Seattle and Born to be Wild.</p>
      <p>Before starting Code Fellows I was working in insurance for Pacific Life Insurance Company. I was there for 5 year. Before that I worked for Verizon Wireless, in the technical service aspect. I was there for almost 9 years. But they decided to have everyone move back east to save money, personally not something I would do.</p>
      <p>For education I have a Bachelors in Business Administration. Some of those classes where online, not a terrible thing and prepared me for Covid-19 virtual learning while with Code Fellows. I cannot wait to keep learning about code and get out and find a job in the field.</p>
